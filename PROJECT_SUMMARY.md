**GeoClimate AI – Command Center**

A global supply chain risk intelligence platform for evaluating, simulating, and optimizing trade lanes.

**Overview**

GeoClimate AI is an end-to-end risk intelligence platform designed to help organizations analyze international supply chains using four key domains: geopolitics, climate vulnerability, logistics reliability, and cybersecurity exposure. It integrates data modeling, mapping, simulation, and generative AI to form a decision-support system for global operations.

The platform acts as a lightweight digital twin of trade networks, enabling teams to understand lane risks, simulate disruptions, compare alternatives, and generate decision-ready reports.

**Core Modules and Their Purpose**
**1. Route Analyzer**

Evaluates a selected trade lane between two countries via sea, air, road, or rail.
It computes:

- Geopolitical risk

- Climate and environmental risk

- Logistics risk

- Cybersecurity risk

- Weighted overall score

Includes:

- Route map visualization

- Risk radar

- Cost estimation

AI explanation of major drivers and mitigation options

**Use**: Understand why a lane is risky and what factors contribute most to exposure.

2. **Scenario Lab**

Simulates disruption scenarios using adjustable multipliers across four dimensions.
Users can model conditions such as:

- Escalating conflict

- Extreme weather

- Congestion or port failures

- Cybersecurity incidents

Produces:

Base vs stressed score comparison

Charts for risk deltas

AI interpretation of scenario implications

**Use**: Test lane resilience under different stress conditions.

3. **Global Heatmap**

Displays a world heatmap combining geopolitical and climate risks.
Includes simulated historical trends for any selected country.

**Use**: Identify regional vulnerabilities and support sourcing or diversification strategy.

4. **AI Strategy Room**

A freeform advisory section powered by generative AI.
Context includes:

- Last analyzed lane

- Stress test results

- Current comparison basket

Generates practical recommendations for:

- Route planning

- Risk mitigation

- Strategic sourcing

- Resilience building

Use: Obtain high-level strategic insight tailored to current analysis.

5. **Network Optimizer**

Automatically generates alternative lane configurations:

Transport mode shift

Alternative origin region

Combined origin and mode change

Each alternative is risk-scored and compared, and AI explains the best choice.

Use: Explore safer or more resilient network configurations.

**6. Export Center**

Provides structured exports of lane summaries in text and PDF formats.

Includes:

- Lane metadata

- Dimension scores

- Weighting preset

- Conflict impacts

- Risk categorization

Use: Shareable documentation for team reviews, stakeholder briefings, and reports.

**Why GeoClimate AI Matters**

Global supply chains face rising instability driven by politics, climate, congestion, and cyber threats. GeoClimate AI offers a structured, transparent, and AI-driven method to understand exposure and make informed decisions quickly.

It enhances clarity, supports scenario planning, and provides actionable recommendations—bridging detailed analytics with executive-level insight.
